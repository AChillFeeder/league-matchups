## Next direction:
A bit ambitious but try to turn it into a sort of social experience, notes can be public and other users can vote on the ones they like.
This way you can find relevant information about matchups you're first-timing, or maybe correct wrong conclusions.
Also it would be necessary to somehow comfirm your league account when making a league matchups account.
